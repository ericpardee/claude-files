# render-url.sh — Render a JavaScript-heavy or bot-protected URL by delegating to
# the Codex CLI, which drives a real (headed) browser and extracts the page's
# visible text. Prints the rendered text to stdout.
#
# Usage:
#   render-url.sh <url> [output_file]
#
# If output_file is omitted, the text is printed to stdout only.
#
# Why Codex with danger-full-access: rendering requires network access (to load
# the page and, on first run, to install a browser engine). Codex's default
# sandbox blocks the network. The safer alternative is:
#     --sandbox workspace-write
# combined with this in ~/.codex/config.toml:
#     [sandbox_workspace_write]
#     network_access = true
# Swap the flag below if you prefer that. With danger-full-access the run is
# fully unattended, which is what this fallback is for.

PROMPT="Render the page at this URL with a real browser and extract its visible text.

URL: ${URL}

Requirements:
- Use a HEADED (NOT headless) Chromium-based browser so bot-protection
  challenges (Cloudflare 'Just a moment' / 'Performing security verification',
  etc.) auto-solve. Headless Chromium gets blocked by these challenges.
- Prefer Playwright. If a real system browser is installed, launch THAT rather
  than bundled Chromium, because a real browser binary clears anti-bot checks far
  more reliably. On macOS try, in order: Google Chrome (Playwright
  channel: 'chrome'), then Brave via executablePath
  '/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser'. Only fall back
  to bundled Chromium (install with 'npx --yes playwright@latest install chromium')
  if no system browser launches.
- Set a realistic desktop User-Agent and a 1280x800 (or larger) viewport.
- Navigate to the URL. If the page shows an interstitial bot/security challenge
  (body text contains 'Just a moment', 'Verifying you are human', 'Performing
  security verification', 'Checking your browser', or only a Cloudflare Ray ID),
  POLL: wait and re-read document.body.innerText every ~3s for up to 60s total,
  until the challenge text is gone and real page content has appeared. Do NOT
  give up after the first read.
- Once past any challenge, allow a few more seconds for single-page-app
  hydration, then extract document.body.innerText (human-visible text), NOT HTML.
- Write ONLY that extracted text to this exact file path: ${OUT}
- Do not print explanations to stdout. The one and only deliverable is the file
  ${OUT}. If after 60s you still cannot get past a challenge or render content,
  write a line beginning with 'RENDER_ERROR:' and a short reason to ${OUT}."
