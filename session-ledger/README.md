# session-ledger

Automatic catalog of every Claude Code and Codex CLI session. Each session gets a short
distilled entry (outcome, artifacts, open threads, resume command) appended
to a single markdown ledger file, newest first. A nightly sweep catches
sessions the SessionEnd hook missed, and a weekly "dream" pass consolidates
the file.

Portable across machines: all machine-specific values (including the ledger
destination) live in `~/.claude/session-ledger.env`, which is never
committed. On a Mac with Obsidian, point `LEDGER_FILE` at a vault note; on a
work Mac, point it at any plain markdown file.

## Install on a new machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ericpardee/claude-files.git ~/Development/github.com/ericpardee/claude-files
cd ~/Development/github.com/ericpardee/claude-files/session-ledger
./install.sh /path/to/ledger.md
python3 ledger.py --seed --days 14
```

Already cloned? `git pull` then rerun `./install.sh` (it is idempotent).

The installer:

1. Writes `~/.claude/session-ledger.env` if missing (commented template).
2. Installs two launchd agents (nightly sweep 02:30, weekly dream Sunday
   03:30) with logs going to `~/.claude/session-ledger.log`.
3. Merges a SessionEnd hook into `~/.claude/settings.json` (skipped if
   already present).

## Secondary installs

Run `install.sh` with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` exported to a second config dir
(for example a work sandbox) and it installs a separate pair of agents whose
labels carry a suffix taken from that dir's parent, with their own env file,
state, log and lock under that dir. Those plists pin `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so
the agents run against the right install.

The default install deliberately leaves `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` out of its
plists. Claude Code keys its Keychain credential on whether the variable is
present, so exporting it, even as `~/.claude`, makes `claude -p` under
launchd report "Not logged in" and every distill fails.

`LEDGER_FILE` may live inside an iCloud-synced Obsidian vault
(`~/Library/Mobile Documents/...`). macOS TCC attributes a launchd agent's
file access to the agent's program and refuses iCloud Drive paths to a
`python3` program with `Operation not permitted`, so the plists start
`ledger.py` through `/bin/bash -c 'exec /usr/bin/python3 ...'`, which is
allowed. Keep that wrapper if you edit the templates.

A sweep in which every distill attempt fails exits non-zero, so
`launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.claude-session-ledger.nightly` shows a
non-zero last exit code the next morning.

## Codex CLI

Codex sessions are part of the same ledger. The sweep reads Codex rollouts
(`$CODEX_HOME/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`, `~/.codex` by default)
next to Claude transcripts; entries for them end in `codex resume <id>`.
Only interactive sessions count: `codex exec` runs and spawned subagent
threads are skipped, and Codex's injected context blocks are not prompts.

The installer appends a `SessionEnd` command hook to `config.toml` (set
`CODEX_HOME` first for a secondary install). Codex passes the same stdin
JSON as Claude Code (`session_id`, `cwd`, `transcript_path`), so the one
hook script serves both. SessionEnd hooks are capped at three seconds; the
hook only spawns the distill and returns.

Distillation can run on either CLI. `DISTILL_TOOL=codex` uses
`codex exec --ephemeral -s read-only` with `CODEX_MODEL` (empty means the
model configured in Codex) at `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` (default `low`).
Ephemeral matters: a non-ephemeral run would leave a rollout that the next
sweep would treat as a session.

## Config reference

`~/.claude/session-ledger.env`, `KEY=VALUE` lines. Process environment
variables with the same names override the file.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LEDGER_FILE` | required | Markdown file entries are appended to |
| `MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Model for distill and dream calls |
| `PROJECTS_DIR` | `~/.claude/projects` | Claude Code transcript location |
| `MIN_NEW_PROMPTS` | `1` | New user prompts needed before redistilling |
| `MAX_EXCERPT_CHARS` | `10000` | Cap on excerpt sent to the model |
| `CODEX_SESSIONS_DIR` | `$CODEX_HOME/sessions` or `~/.codex/sessions` | Codex rollouts to sweep; `none` disables |
| `DISTILL_TOOL` | `claude` | `claude` (claude -p) or `codex` (codex exec) |
| `CODEX_MODEL` | unset | Model for `codex exec` distills; unset uses Codex's configured model |
| `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` | `low` | Reasoning effort for `codex exec` distills |
| `BACKFILL_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | `30` | A never-seen session older than this is marked stale, not distilled; `--seed --days N` backfills deliberately |
| `POST_SWEEP_CMD` | unset | Shell command run after a sweep that distilled at least one session, and after a successful dream (for example a script that commits and pushes the ledger). 300s timeout, exit code logged |

Other files:

- `~/.claude/session-ledger.state.json` tracks per-session progress
- `~/.claude/session-ledger.log` one line per action or skip
- `~/.claude/session-ledger.lock` prevents hook and cron collisions
- `~/.claude/session-ledger-runs/` cwd for `claude -p` calls (recursion
  guard: sessions created there are never cataloged)

## Modes

```bash
python3 ledger.py --sweep              # distill sessions with new activity
python3 ledger.py --session <path|id>  # distill one session (hook uses this)
python3 ledger.py --seed --days 14     # backfill recent sessions
python3 ledger.py --dream              # weekly consolidation
python3 ledger.py --sweep --dry-run    # any mode: print, write nothing
```

## How the dream pass works

Weekly, `--dream` sends the whole ledger to `claude -p` and rewrites it in
place: duplicate or related entries merge, resolved threads get marked
closed, and every `claude --resume <id>` line is preserved. It also puts a
short `## Promote to memory` section at the top with durable facts worth
adding to long-term memory, for human review. The previous version is kept
at `LEDGER_FILE.bak`. A model response that is malformed, or that drops any
`claude --resume <id>` present in the input, leaves the ledger untouched and
the run exits non-zero.

## Cost

Haiku by default. Roughly one short call per active session per day (the
excerpt is capped at 10k characters), plus one larger call per week for the
dream pass. A day with five active sessions costs a few cents.

Distill calls get five minutes each. The dream call rewrites the whole file
and is allowed thirty minutes; a ledger of around 80 entries needs more than
five, so expect the Sunday run to take a while.

## Uninstall

```bash
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)/com.claude-session-ledger.nightly"
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)/com.claude-session-ledger.dream"
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-session-ledger.*.plist
```

Then remove the `session-ledger` entry from `hooks.SessionEnd` in
`~/.claude/settings.json`, and optionally delete
`~/.claude/session-ledger.{env,state.json,log}` and
`~/.claude/session-ledger-runs/`.
